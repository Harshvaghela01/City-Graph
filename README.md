# City-Graph-
 The City Distance Visualization Project is a web application designed to display the distances between various cities on an interactive graph. Leveraging the Django framework, this project offers users a user-friendly interface to explore the distances between different cities efficiently.
City Database: The project incorporates a comprehensive database containing information about numerous cities and their geographic coordinates.

Distance Calculation: Using the geographic coordinates of the cities stored in the database, the application calculates the distances between any two cities accurately.

Interactive Graph: The distance information is presented to users in the form of an interactive graph, making it easy to visualize the spatial relationships between cities.

Search Functionality: Users can search for specific cities or choose them from a dropdown menu to visualize their distances from other cities.

Responsive Design: The web application is designed to be responsive, ensuring seamless usability across various devices and screen sizes.

User Authentication (Optional): Optionally, user authentication functionality can be implemented to allow registered users to save their favorite cities or customize their graph settings.

Technology Stack:

Django Framework: Django is utilized as the primary web framework for developing the project, providing a robust structure for building web applications.
Python: Python programming language is used for backend development, including distance calculation algorithms and database management.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: These front-end technologies are employed to design and implement the user interface and interactive features.
SQLite/PostgreSQL: Depending on the scale and requirements of the project, either SQLite or PostgreSQL can be used as the database management system to store city data.
Google Maps API (Optional): Integration with Google Maps API can enhance the visualization by providing a visual representation of the cities and their distances on a map.
